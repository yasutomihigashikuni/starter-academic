## Overview

Our ultimate goal is to create “living machines” that enable automatic reversal of aging phenotypes and maintenance of homeostasis. Living machines could be bacteria or mammalian cells in which artificial biological programs are encoded into the genome as synthetic gene circuits. These cells would sense and process multiple inputs, including extracellular environment and intracellular condition, and produce the optimal outputs. Our living machines could be interconnected to digital devices for external control. These technologies will enable personalized medicine at cellular level. 

To achieve this goal, our research utilizes both top-down and bottom-up approaches. Top-down approach, including multi-omics and large-scale phenotypic screening, provides pathogenic basis of cardiovascular disease and the optimal sensors and effectors for its treatment. By bottom-up approaches, we are designing and optimizing artificial biological programs, including their parts, for clinical use. By combining these findings and technologies, we are developing next-generation gene and cell therapies for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.
