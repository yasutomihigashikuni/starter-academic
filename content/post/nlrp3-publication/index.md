## **Neural Control of Cardiac Inflammation**

Inflammation is involved in the pathophysiology of cardiac remodeling and hypertrophy. However, very little is known about the mechanism that controls cardiac inflammation and hypertrophy.
In this study, we demonstrated that neural signals control cardiac inflammation and hypertrophy through NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1beta production during pressure overload.
