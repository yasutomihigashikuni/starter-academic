## **Combinatorial miRNAs for Doxorubicin Cardiotoxicity**

Anthracycline chemotherapeutics for cancer such as doxorubicin cause cardiomyocyte loss and heart failure. Therapeutics that prevent doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy are urgently needed.
In this study, we identified a microRNA combination that synergistically and potently protects against doxorubicin cardiotoxicity, by using a novel phenotypic screening technology, CombiGEM.
