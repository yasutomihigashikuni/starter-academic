abstract: Tako-tsubo-like cardiomyopathy is a newly-recognized enigmatic disease characterized by transient left ventricular dysfunction of a broad area of the apex with a hyperkinetic area around the cardiac base. There is ST-segment elevation with no coronary stenosis. The exact mechanism for this entity remains unknown. Here, we report a case of tako-tsubo-like cardiomyopathy that showed a marked left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) when the wall motion returned to normal. LVH was normalized at 10 months. The cause of LVH remains unknown.
