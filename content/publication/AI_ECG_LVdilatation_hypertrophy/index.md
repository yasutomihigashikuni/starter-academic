abstract: Left ventricular dilatation (LVD) and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) are risk factors for heart failure, and their detection improves heart failure screening. This study aimed to investigate the ability of deep learning to detect LVD and LVH from a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). Using ECG and echocardiographic data, we developed deep learning and machine learning models to detect LVD and LVH. We also examined conventional ECG criteria for the diagnosis of LVH. We calculated the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of each model and compared the performance of the models. We analyzed data for 18,954 patients (mean age (standard deviation): 64.2 (16.5) years, men: 56.7%). For the detection of LVD, the value (95% confidence interval) of the AUROC was 0.810 (0.801-0.819) for the deep learning model, and this was significantly higher than that of the logistic regression and random forest methods (P < 0.001). The AUROCs for the logistic regression and random forest methods (machine learning models) were 0.770 (0.761-0.779) and 0.757 (0.747-0.767), respectively. For the detection of LVH, the AUROC was 0.784 (0.777-0.791) for the deep learning model, and this was significantly higher than that of the logistic regression and random forest methods and conventional ECG criteria (P < 0.001). The AUROCs for the logistic regression and random forest methods were 0.758 (0.751-0.765) and 0.716 (0.708-0.724), respectively. This study suggests that deep learning is a useful method to detect LVD and LVH from 12-lead ECGs.
