abstract: Objective: To clarify the impact of breast cancer resistance protein 1 (BCRP1)/ATP-binding cassette transporter subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2) expression on cardiac repair after myocardial infarction (MI). Methods and results: The ATP-binding cassette transporter BCRP1/ABCG2 is expressed in various organs, including the heart, and may regulate several tissue defense mechanisms. BCRP1/ABCG2 was mainly expressed in endothelial cells of microvessels in the heart. MI was induced in 8- to 12-week-old wild-type (WT) and Bcrp1/Abcg2 knockout (KO) mice by ligating the left anterior descending artery. At 28 days after MI, the survival rate was significantly lower in KO mice than in WT mice because of cardiac rupture. Echocardiographic, hemodynamic, and histological assessments showed that ventricular remodeling was more deteriorated in KO than in WT mice. Capillary, myofibroblast, and macrophage densities in the peri-infarction area at 5 days after MI were significantly reduced in KO compared with WT mice. In vitro experiments demonstrated that inhibition of BCRP1/ABCG2 resulted in accumulation of intracellular protoporphyrin IX and impaired survival of microvascular endothelial cells under oxidative stress. Moreover, BCRP1/ABCG2 inhibition impaired migration and tube formation of endothelial cells. Conclusions: BCRP1/ABCG2 plays a pivotal role in cardiac repair after MI via modulation of microvascular endothelial cell survival and function.
