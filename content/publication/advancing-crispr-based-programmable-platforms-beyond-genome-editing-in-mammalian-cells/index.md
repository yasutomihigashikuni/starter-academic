abstract: Human diseases are caused by dysregulation of cellular biological programs that are encoded in DNA. Unveiling the endogenous programs and encoding new programs into the genome are key to creating novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. CRISPR/Cas9, originally identified in bacteria, has revolutionized genome editing in mammalian cells. Recent advances in CRISPR technologies have provided new programmable platforms for modifying cell function and behavior. CRISPR-based transcriptional regulators and modified gRNAs have enabled multiplexed regulation and visualization of genome dynamics with spatiotemporal precision. Using these toolkits, genome-scale screening platforms can identify key genetic elements or combinations thereof that modulate phenotypes in mammalian cells. In addition, imaging platforms for multiplexed genomic labeling have been created to study the conformation and dynamics of chromatin in living cells, which are essential for genome function. Furthermore, CRISPR-based computation and memory platforms have been built in living mammalian cells by using DNA as a data processing and storage medium to regulate and monitor cellular behaviors. The conditional regulation of CRISPR-based parts has enabled the design of complex multilayered biological programs. CRISPR-based memory platforms can continuously record biological events as mutations in defined DNA loci. By making use of base editors, CRISPR-based computation and memory platforms have been interconnected to perform logic operations based on past events. These technologies open up new avenues for understanding biological phenomena and designing mammalian cells as living machines for biomedical applications.
