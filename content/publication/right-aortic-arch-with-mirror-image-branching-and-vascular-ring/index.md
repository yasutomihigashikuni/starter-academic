abstract: A right aortic arch is a rare congenital anomaly. This condition is occasionally found with atherosclerotic changes of the anomalous vessels, dissection, or aneurysmal dilatation in adulthood by emergence of symptoms or incidentally by radiographic studies for an evaluation of other diseases. This condition is clinically relevant because of the morbidity caused by compression of mediastinal structures by anomalous vessels and the mortality associated with rupture of aneurysms. In this report, we present a very rare case of a 70-year-old male patient with the right aortic arch with mirror image branching and vascular ring incidentally found by radiographic studies in adulthood.
