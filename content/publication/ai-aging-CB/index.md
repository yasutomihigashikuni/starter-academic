abstract: Chest X-ray is one of the most widely used medical imaging tests worldwide to diagnose and manage heart and lung diseases. In this study, we developed a computer-based tool to predict patients’ age from chest X-rays. The tool precisely estimated patients’ age from chest X-rays. Furthermore, in patients with heart failure and those admitted to the intensive care unit for cardiovascular disease, elevated X-ray age estimated by our tool was associated with poor clinical outcomes, including readmission for heart failure or death from any cause. With further testing, our tool may help clinicians to predict outcomes in patients with heart disease based on a simple chest X-ray.
