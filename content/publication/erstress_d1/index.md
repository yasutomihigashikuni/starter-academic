abstract: Dopamine D1 receptor (D1R), coded by the Drd1 gene, is induced in cardiomyocytes of failing hearts, triggering heart failure-associated ventricular arrhythmia, and therefore could be a potential therapeutic target for chronic heart failure. The regulation of D1R expression, however, is not fully understood. Here, we explored the molecular mechanism by which cardiomyocyte D1R is induced in failing hearts. We performed motif analysis for the promoter region of the Drd1 gene using the transcription factor affinity prediction (TRAP) method and identified nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) as a candidate transcriptional factor regulating the expression of the Drd1 gene. We next employed murine models of heart failure from chronic pressure overload by transverse aortic constriction (TAC), and assessed myocardial Drd1 expression levels and NF-κB activity, as well as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of heart failure. Drd1 induction in TAC hearts was dependent on the severity of heart failure, and was associated with NF-κB activation and ER stress, as assessed by p65 phosphorylation and the expression of ER stress-related genes, respectively. We further tested if Drd1 was induced by ER stress via NF-κB activation in cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. Tunicamycin activated NF-κB pathway in an ER stress-dependent manner and increased Drd1 expression. Importantly, inhibition of NF-κB pathway by pretreatment with Bay11-7082 completely suppressed the tunicamycin-induced upregulation of Drd1, suggesting that NF-κB activation is essential to this regulation. Our study demonstrates the pivotal role for the ER stress-induced NF-κB activation in the induction of D1R in cardiomyocytes. Intervention of this pathway might be a potential new therapeutic strategy for heart failure-associated ventricular arrhythmia.
