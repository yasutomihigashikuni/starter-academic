Artificial intelligence is a powerful tool to perform optimal prediction, using multiple inputs, for personalized medicine. In this era of Big Data, unified management and analysis of clinical data have been facilitated. 

We are exploring methods and systems to integrate dynamic in vivo data from “living machines” into the unified management system of clinical data for more precise prediction and selection of optimal therapeutic strategies, by interconnecting “living machines” to digital devices.
