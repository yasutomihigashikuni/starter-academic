Heart failure is a multifactorial diseased condition that is caused by the set-point shift of complex biological programs. Biological programs are executed by transforming information in the genome into protein synthesis. This process is mediated by RNA. In the process between transcription and translation, RNA undergoes various metabolic changes and modifications, which modulates RNA function and subsequently biological phenotypes. Currently, very little is known about the roles and the mechanisms of RNA metabolism and modification in the pathogenesis of heart failure. 

In this project, we will elucidate RNA metabolism and modification that cause heart failure, and create novel heart failure therapies targeting these processes. We have identified several regulators of RNA metabolism and modification that are involved in protection of cardiomyocytes against pathological stressors by genome-scale phenotypic screening. By examining their roles in heart failure with multi-omics approach, we are deciphering epitranscriptome code in the pathogenesis of heart failure. Our findings will represent significant strides forward in understanding and treating heart failure.
